## Rosa, Neil, and Ian's fun Cinder Game!

# Hangman

### Instructions:
To begin the game the person who will pick the word launches the oscGameApp.cpp.
They will be prompted to type a word into the grey box. 
Once typed and enter is pressed the word will be set.


After the word has been set other players can join the game by launching the HangmanGuestApp.cpp 
The waiting host receives connections and responds to new connections by sending a player ID to the new player.
Once two players have joined the game can begin.

The players then take turns guessing a letter until the hangman is drawn or the word is guessed.
